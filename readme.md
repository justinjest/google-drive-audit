# Google drive auditing tool

## Problem:
Google drive has an inherent security vulnerability created by users genearting links to share the data with anyone. For security critical infrastructure like healthcare, education, and banking, these files should be regularly reviewed and audited in order to prevent any accidental leaks. During COVID 19 some agencies opted to use google drive as a temporary stopgap in order to allow for buisness to continue with a new work paradigm, however they did not all set up robust auditing workflows.

In order to help resolve some of these vulnerabilities without requiring massive hiring of QA leads and generating an auditing workflow, this tool is deisgined to assist you in doing this work automatically. 

THank you to Jack Rhysider and Professor Dubstep in Darknet Diaries ep 148 for bringing this vulnerability to my attention. 

## Results:
This product will provide you with a list of items in your google drive that have a link that allows anyone with the link to see the drive.
